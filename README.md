JaIoC
=====

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/k86mls2wu3ael0tc?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gerich-home/jaioc)

Quite powerfull and flexible IoC / DI Container for C#

Code is distributed under MS-PL License.

Author is Sergey Gerasimov.


This IoC container is inspired by ideas of Funq.
I tried to generalize it somewhere, add some extension points to it.

Both constructor and property dependency injection ways are supported.
