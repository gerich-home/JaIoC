JaIoC
=====

Quite powerfull and flexible IoC / DI Container for C#

Code is distributed under MS-PL License.

Author is Sergey Gerasimov.


This IoC container is inspired by ideas of Funq.
I tried to generalize it somewhere, add some extension points to it.

Both constructor and property dependency injection ways are supported.
